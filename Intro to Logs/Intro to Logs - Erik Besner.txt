Pcap
1. Looks like communication with a Windows server for updates and downloads
2. Qemu pops up so possibly for a virtual machine


Web Proxies
1. Http GET requests are being made
2. There are two HTTP status codes: 304 - not modified & 200 - OK
3. Each line uses the same proxy service
   1. Each line has different cache resource codes - https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/167160/what-are-the-cache-hitmiss-codes-results.html
   2. Proxy service directs traffic through the service then to the destination; middleman


Firewalls
1. TCP is allowed by UFW
2. Destination port 80 is allowed by UFW
3. 3 different IP addresses are found in the log
4. Bootp - bootstrap protocol is most likely what is being blocked on UDP:67
   1. This is typically an exploit to bypass security using udp protocol


Netflow
1. The users are visiting Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and Amazon
2. There are 24 unique clients
   1. You can see this by clicking on the Hosts dropdown.
3. 10.0.3.15 is searching for exploits and doing research on Kali tools, but I can’t see who he is targeting
4. 192.168.56.102 is the most common server being used by clients
   1. You can see this by going to the Flows tab and sorting by Servers


DNS
1. Headers
   1. $1 – date/time
   2. $2 – source ip
   3. $3 – source port
   4. $4 – dest ip
   5. $5 – dest port
   6. $6 – ?packet size? # # # #
   7. $7 – domain/website
   8. $8 – dns 
   9. $9 – ?dns ip addresses? # # # #
2. 192.168.1.254,192.168.15.1,192.168.15.2,192.168.15.4,192.168.1.64 are the actors communicating
3. Shorter log lines are queries; longer log lines are responses
4. Most websites being queried are name servers


Host logs
1. The description of the process happening is on the right
2. It appears that Veer is operating VMWare Fusion which is attempting to move file, which the system pauses on and then allows, and the process continues


Linux syslog
1. The hostname is debian
2. The system is mounting a new usb storage device
3. Interesting locations
   1. /sys/devices/
   2. /dev/sdb1
   3. /media/corey/veer
4. USB Mass Storage Device
5. Veer
6. This could be an opportunistic attack using a USB (USB drop attack)


Scripting
1. There are 27253 src IP and 123 dst IP
   1. $cat iptablesyslog | awk ‘{print $[12-14]}’ | grep SRC > <file>
   2. $cat iptablesyslog | awk ‘{print $[11-15]}’ | grep DST > <file>
   3. $cat <file> | sort -u > <newfile>
   4. $wc <newfile>
2. There are 3 protocols used: TCP, UDP, ICMP
   1. $cat iptablesyslog | awk ‘{print $[19-22]}’ | grep PROTO > <file>
   2. $cat <file> | sort -u > <newfile>
